# EcoBin-Connect-main
In our university campus, the existing solid waste management system is inefficient, leading to issues such as overflowing bins and improper waste disposal. Additionally, there is a lack of a streamlined process for reporting waste-related concerns. To address these challenges, we aim to develop a comprehensive solution that integrates IoT-enabled smart dustbins capable of monitoring fill levels and automatic lid control with a user-friendly website. This system will not only prevent overflowing bins but also encourage community engagement by allowing users to report improper waste disposal and access educational resources on waste management. Our challenge is to seamlessly integrate these hardware and software components to create the "EcoBin Connect" system, contributing to a cleaner, smarter, and more sustainable campusÂ environment.
